# Deep-Neural-Networks-with-Multi-Branch-Architectures-Are-Less-Non-Convex

This is the code for the paper "Deep Neural Networks with Multi-Branch Architectures Are Less Non-Convex".

The code is written in python and requires numpy, pytorch, pickle, sklearn, theano and the lasagne library.

# Install

This code depends on python3.6, pytorch 0.3.1 and numpy. We suggest to install the dependencies using Anaconda or Miniconda.

# Using the code

The command `python A.py --help` gives the help information about how to run the code that produces landscape, and `python B.py --help` explains how to run the multi-branch neural network based on VGG-9.
